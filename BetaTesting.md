# Introduction #
FIMv3 is a **complete** rewrite of VRIM2. It is not a simple addition of features (and, in truth, there are few of those), but rather a ground-up rewrite of the original infrastructure. As you may expect, this also means any bugs that have been fixed in the past may have resurfaced, and many others may have disappeared.

Some things are still not quite as I wish - for this, a fourth beta is to be created - but at this point the entirety of VRIM2 should have been recreated, with but a few exceptions.

You should already know what to do; report bugs in the [bug tracker](http://code.google.com/p/freeze-messenger/issues/list), focusing on the below data if possible:


# Areas of Interest #
  * Feedback on the Archive
  * Feedback on Right Clicking, Alternate Right Click Method, and Avatar Mode
  * Browser Support (note: if a browser is completely broken, the page won't show right - for the worst of the worst, you will be redirected to a browser page, while for the "sooo close!" the entire page will just /be/ broken)
    * Browsers
      * IE8
      * IE9
      * IE10
      * Firefox (the latest, 6 as of writing)

    * Features / Oddities of Interest

      * RAM (see things to do)

# Things To Do #
  * Create Lots and Lots of Data (largely spam): Make many rooms, post a lot in the main room, etc.
  * Have fun trying to exploit things, just knowing not to bug me about the things below.

# Yeah, It's Broken, I Know #
The following things aren't working; don't worry about them:
  * Private Messaging (will be overhauled in B4) - This includes the ignore/unignore feature thingy, btw.
  * Internet Explorer 8 - Don't bother me with it /yet/.
  * Room creation / editing is a bit buggy. Worry about that in the next beta. Still, feel free to create a million rooms.
