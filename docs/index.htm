        <h2 id="about">About FreezeMessenger</h2>

        <p>The FreezeMessenger Instant Messenger Software (“FIM” or “FreezeMessenger” as its typically referred to as) was created to resolve the great number of issues with traditional online redistributable networking clients: a heavy server footprint, the inability to properly moderate, the inn ability to easily extent with other interfaces (even those not on the web at all), a lack of proper data encryption, and more. In doing so it has risen above its author’s expectations of stability, speed, and general feature-set. During its original incarnation the great many features sported today were never planned, yet in a mere matter of months came to shine.</p>

        <p>A full history lesson may prove too boring, as may the many spelling and math lessons that one must learn to be able to reproduce the feat contained within. Instead, what matters: FreezeMessenger is capable of running on any vBulletin Forum with PHP 5.3 or higher and MySQL. It will work in nearly any browser (counting the Lite layout, supported browsers include Internet Explorer 6+, Mozilla Firefox 3+, Opera 9+, Konqueror 4.6, Google Chrome, and Apple Safari), on any operating system (Linux, Macintosh, Windows, Haiku, FreeBSD, OpenBSD, and so-on), on every modern computer. Its advanced API enabled     any interested developer to create brilliant frontends, with some having created terminal frontends, and others having created good-ol-fashioned MSN/AIM-like frontends. The API even exposes technology not yet utilized in the main Web Interface, such as the ability to show a user’s status.</p>

        <p>FreezeMessenger’s other technology feats are numerous: among them its advanced censor support (though to be honest the developer is not overly happy at this specific accomplishment), full database encryption, room creation and advanced permissioning, database file uploads, and even more. The software is licensed entirely under the General Public License Version 3, and full sourcecode can be obtained by contacting Joseph T. Parsons via rehtaew@gmail.com (a later redistributable version will be made available, but for several reasons will not be released until Summer 2011).</p>

        <p>A brief Version History and Browser Support Notes can be found below. Other links are also given at the bottom to separate sections of this documentation. I truly hope you find the software as impressive as I do, and if you find a bug or make a change, I would love to incorporate it in the original code. Please, should you be so kind, email me at rehtaew@gmail.com and I will give full credit to your contribution.</p>

        <h2 id="requirements">Server Requirements</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>PHP 5.0+</li>
          <li>MySQL</li>
          <li>200MB+ RAM (this may vary; larger implementations may benefit from increasing the level of message caching from the default 100 messages, costing RAM but saving time and CPU)</li>
          <li>Apache and LigHTTPD both tested; IIS should also work.</li>
        </ul>

      <section>
        <h2 id="crystalball">Future Plans</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>The current upload system supports limited tagging, file ratings, and permissions, but it is not possible to change these at the moment. Instead, a plugin would need to provide a proper API and modify the interface to support such.</li>
          <li>Messages retrieval only works well using POLLing, with limited support for Long-POLLing. In the future PUSH support may be added and the Long-POLL implementation stabilized.</li>
          <li>One of the most requested features currently is support for audio and video communication. Both may be possible in the near future by combining browser support of the P2P Javascript API, and/or the HTML5 Devices Specification. Alternate Adobe Flash-based methods could be explored by third-party plugins.</li>
          <li>Support for alternate database backends is planned. The 3.0 release already attempts to make eventual transition as easy as possible by using specialized insert queries.</li>
        </ul>
