/**
 * Generates a password hash using a password, salt, and optionally a number of iterations to run the encryption over. The function will also make use of salts stored in config.php to prevent bruteforcing of passwords in the case of a database leak.
 *
 * @param string $password - The password.
 * @param string $salt - The salt to use. This salt is stored in the database.
 * @param string $privateSaltNum - The private salt to use. This salt is referrenced in the database, but stored on the fileserver.
 * @param int $hashStage - The level at which the password is already hashed. 0 is no hashing, 1 is sha256(password), 2 is sha256(sha256(password) . salt), and 3 is fully hashed.
 * @return void - true on success, false on failure
