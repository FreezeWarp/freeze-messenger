/* If you have no idea what "PHP" or "MySQL" is...
 * We strongly encourage you to ask a friend who may know a thing or two to help.
 * Or, better yet, why not just use that handy-dandy installation tool?
 * If you are editing post-installation or for some reason trying without the tool, a few pointers:
 -- Arrays must be formatted properly. They will generally look something like this:
  array(
    'a' => 1,
    3 => 'b',
    '22' => 99,
  );

  Using a "=" in place of a "=>" won't work, and forgetting to add a comma is a big no-no.
