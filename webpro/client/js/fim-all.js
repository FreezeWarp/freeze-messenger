/* Global Definitions
* These are used throughout all other Javascript files, so are defined before all other FIM-specific files.


* Needed Changes:
  * Consistency in use of templates+raw HTML.
  * Password Encryption
  * Get rid of the f*cking "active" variable. I must have have been incredibly high when I decided it would be good to store JSON in it. (Caffeine is a seriously bad drug, kids.)

/* Coding Notes:
 * I try to do things in as few lines as possible, because this file is fricken massive. I previously would store, for instance, parts of HTML in variables; now, if possible, I append immediately. */
