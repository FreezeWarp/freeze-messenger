<strong>A Quick Introduction</strong><br />
Victory Road Instant Messenger is a program, still in early development, which allows for fast and effective communication through the community. No more slow-response PMs, and no having to worry about who uses what service: its all here, and free. Simply sign up for Victory Road and you\'re good to go.<br /><br />

<strong>The Different Sections of a Chat</strong><br />
In the main chat window, there are three seperate sections. On the upper-left you will find a list of official available rooms. Other, user-created rooms, can be seen by clicking "<img src="http://vrc.victoryroad.net/images/view-list-details.png" class="standard" alt="Veiw All Rooms" />" (you can also change the topic here). On the lower-left you will find the text entry area. Here you enter messages into the chat, which then appear with the rest of the conversation found in the third section to the right.<br /><br />

<strong>Creating a Room</strong><br />
By clicking "<img src="http://vrc.victoryroad.net/images/document-new.png" class="standard" alt="Create Room" /> you will be able to create your own room. These are useful for simply talking with one or more friends, or, should you wish, even creating a full-fledged group with additional moderators and everything. Either way, here is where you can find more granular control over who you talk to and how. Keep in mind that you must still follow the rules best possible: the main one being no hatespeech or illegal content.<br /><br />

<strong>Talking to Strangers</strong><br />
In general, we recommend being at least 13 years of age if you wish to be a part of any conversation not listed as a "Public (Offical)" channel. Regardless, avoid dislosing personally identifiable information such as your name, picture, birthday, or location.<br /><br />

<strong>Technical Requirements</strong><br />
At present you will need a fairly modern browser to fully experience VRIM - Internet Explorer 9 is much better than Internet Explorer 8 if you have the option to install it, while Safari, Firefox, Chrome, and Opera are also good choices. Android, iPhone, and the DSi also seem to work, but there are no guarentees.<br /><br />

<strong>Version</strong><br />
