/**
 * Get the Active User's Unread Messages.
 * An "unread message" is created whenever a message is inserted into a room watched by a user, or a private room that that user is a part of, and the user does not appear to be online (according to the ping table/database->getActiveUsers()).
 *
 * Future-proofing note (this behaviour is planned but not yet implemented):
 * If a user is online, new messages in *private* rooms will instead be sent to the user's event stream. Due to possible backend limitations, messages in *watched* rooms that the user is not in (but is online) will still be recorded here. As a result, having a poll of getUnreadMessages.php, and a stream from events.php?user=x is recommended; the two attempt to be mutually exclusive. If the client does not support event streaming, there will be no way to query new messages to private rooms; they are not logged here, to avoid concerns with managing duplication.
