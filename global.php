/* Make Sure Required PHP Extensions are Present
 *
 * Note that:
 * MySQL is present in all versions since PHP 4
 * JSON is present in all versions of PHP since 5.2 (but is not actually used in FIMv3)
 ** JSON is used if APC is not available
 * MBString is present in all versions of PHP since 4.3
 * MCrypt is present in all versions since PHP 4
 * PCRE is present in all versions since PHP 4
 * APC is present in PHP 5.4, Ubuntu's php-apc packge, and easily installed from PECL.net. It simply has to be a requirement for many of the functions (as far as the way they are designed).
 * DOM is in all of PHP 5.
 *
 * The following are used, but with safe fallbacks:
 * Hash is present in all versions since PHP 5.1.2; MHash is present in all versions since PHP4
